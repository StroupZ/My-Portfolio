# My Portfolio
Demo: https://stroupz.vercel.app/
<br><br>
This is my personal portfolio I use to introduce myself and showcase my work. Stylistically, it is designed to be both elegant and dynamic. The single page layout features distinct sections, including an animated 'intro' section, an 'about' section for introduction, a 'skills' section with my abilities and tech, a 'projects' section with links to my work and their respective github repos, and a 'contact' section where people can reach me.
<br><br>
## Tech Stack
- TypeScript for primary language
- React for UI
- Next.js for deployment
- Vercel for deployment
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animation
- Locomotive Scroll for dynamic scrolling
